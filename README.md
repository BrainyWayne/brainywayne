## I'm a Software Engineer, Mobile Developer, and Website Developer

- ðŸ”­ I am working on a blockchain, NLP, and RSA encryption based telehealth software as my final year project ðŸ˜ƒ
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything, but mostly Flutter and React ðŸ¤£
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other developers to build the software that helps cure cancer ðŸ˜‰
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to watch science videos, especially space related, and develop indie games. I may be addicted to flutter but that's normal right? Right?ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜‚
